            <h3>History</h3>
            <blockquote>
              The company was founded by Adolf Dassler after a fallout with his
              brother Rudolf Dassler, who later went on to create Puma.The name
              Adidas comes from a combination of the founders nickname Adi and the
              first three letters of his last name Dassler. Adidas gained
              popularity in 1954 when the German national football team won the
              FIFA World Cup wearing Adidas cleats with screw-in studs.It became a
              global sportswear leader by innovating designs and collaborating
              with athletes and celebrities.
